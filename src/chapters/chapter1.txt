DAFFY It’s my first day at Kaisei High School. I arrived at my homeroom a few minutes early.

DAFFY There’s two girls sitting next to me. We were all childhood friends.

DAFFY On my left is DAFFY.

<SHOW DAFFY.NEUTRAL 2 FADE 1>
<WAIT 1>

DAFFY DAFFY is the captain of the girls swim team. She’s really strong and could probably beat you in an arm wrestle.

DAFFY Not only is she really athletic, but she is also really good at academics. 

DAFFY She always helps me study for our history tests but I always end up flopping… somehow… but that’s just because I'm bad. Not because DAFFY is a bad teacher or anything!

DAFFY She’s smart, beautiful, and stro… ok nothing, moving on.

<HIDE DAFFY FADE 1>
<SHOW ASTER.NEUTRAL 3 FADE 1>

DAFFY On my right is ASTER. 

DAFFY She’s well. She’s just a kid…

DAFFY She likes to eat a lot of sashimi at the conveyor belt sushi bar. She also likes to read a lot of visual novels (not this one though cause it sucks).

DAFFY However, she is awful at school. I don’t think she ever studied for tests in middle school and um. Her homework, she does her homework 5 minutes before class starts. But she’s also really cool!

DAFFY I gave her that hat for her 11th birthday, and she hasn’t taken it off since… which is kind of weird but…

DAFFY Moving on!
